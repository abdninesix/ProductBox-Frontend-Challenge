Productbox Frontend Code Challenge
==================================

This is a RandoStore challenge mini project from Productbox

Overview
--------
RandoStore is an online store where users can list random items for sale and add them to their cart. The project consists of a backend (Node.js & Express) that serves item data and a frontend (React & Tailwind CSS) for a seamless user experience.

Features:

View Items – Fetch and display items from the backend.

Add New Items – Users can submit a form to add new items, which are stored in init_data.json.

Shopping Cart – Items can be added to the cart, with quantity controls.

Persistent Storage – Cart data is stored in local storage for persistence.

Clean UI – Styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express

Storage: Local storage (for cart), JSON file (for item data)

Instructions
---------------
Install the package dependencies in `both` folders, client and server by running the command: `npm install`

Build the client side app by running the command: `npm run build`. This is important because the frontend will run through the backend.

Now you can start the `server` side application by running: `npm start`

Once the server is running, you can access the RandoStore by opening your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
